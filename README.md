# Welcome to the Library of Alexandria!
Live Link: https://libraryalexandria.herokuapp.com/login

Take a tour around the library, explorer. Read some of our countless books and scrolls. Write your own, and leave them here to be immortalized.

Simply talk to our librarian to help you explore our selection. If you wish to write a scroll, do not fear if you cannot write. Our scribe (it's hard to miss her) will help you create a beautiful work of your own imagination.

If you wish to view or write in our logs to correspond with our other authors and readers, simply speak to the scribe and say you wish to chat.
